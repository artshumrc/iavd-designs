<h2 id="whatIs">What is MannX/ELM</h2>
<p> MannX (<em><strong>Multimedia Annotator - XML</strong></em>)
is a software program to control and modify digital video and associated
 texts: transcripts, commentaries, and glossaries. ELM (<em><strong>English-Language
Materials</strong></em>)
is a MannX application that contains materials for learning English as
a second language at all levels, beginning to advanced. In this guide
we  mostly present MannX as used for ELM, but MannX  is also
used for creating educational materials for other languages, or in
subjects other than foreign languages.</p>
<p>MannX makes it possible for even
beginning language students to work with unabridged, idiomatic video
and text. A MannX  consists of units or lessons. Each lesson is based on a video clip several minutes long and related textual materials: the  transcript of the  clip, commentaries, and exercises. A  dictionary and a set of grammar
materials are shared among all lessons. </p>
<p>MannX is really two programs with  shared components: the MannX Player and the MannX Author. The Player is  simpler to install. This is a program for navigation, playback and search. It cannot modify the contents of the unit in any way. In general, it cannot modify the contents of your hard drive. To start the  Player, you simply click on the Web page that contains the texts of the unit you want to work with. If you have a fast Internet connection, you can also use the Player to access MannX archives over the Web. </p>
<p>MannX Author has all the functionality of the Player but in addition, it can edit and save files on your hard drive. MannX  Author requires a <a href="#installplus" title="Installation with Web server">slightly more complex installation</a> than the Player. Basically, it needs a web server program installed on your computer. </p>
<p>There are three ways to use MannX: as a desktop application; as a Web application over the Internet; and as an Off-Line Web Application (OWA). Each way has its advantages and disadvantages, but OWA is probably the best for most users.</p>
<h2 id="install">Installation Instructions </h2>
<p>There are three ways to use MannX: as a desktop application; as a Web application over the Internet; and as an Off-Line Web Application (OWA). Each way has its advantages and disadvantages, but OWA is probably the best for most users.</p>

<h3 id="browserreq">General Browser Requirement </h3>
<p align="left">In order to use MannX, you need the Firefox browser (version 1.5 or later) with the Flash Plugin, version 8 or later. Both are free, and Firefox is Open Source. Firefox can be downloaded  from <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/" title="download Firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla.org</a>, where you also find installation instructions. There is a page for downloading the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Windows US-Englsih version</a>, and a page for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html" target="_blank">all available languages and platforms</a>. Once it is installed and started, you can download the Flash plugin from the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:7" target="_blank">Plug-in section</a> of the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/" target="_blank">general Add-ons page</a>.</p>


<h3 id="webapp">Web Application</h3>
<p align="left"> In order to use MannX-ELM over the web, you only need the general requirement above. Once you have downloaded and installed the browser and the plugin, you can start using MannX ELM materials from this website:</p>
<p align="left">
<a href="http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/mannxelm/" title="English Language Materials" target="_blank">http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/mannxelm/</a></p>

<h3 align="left">Copying the Materials to Your Computer</h3>
<p align="left">If you use MannX locally, as a desktop application or an Off-Line Web application, you  have to install the MannX materials themselves, either from a CDROM or from the Web. Installing the MannX materials simply means copying two directories, one with all the textual materials, the other with the videos. The videos directory must be called &quot;movies.&quot; The other directory can be given any name but it has to be placed next to the movies directory. (We call it mfmx, which stands for &quot;MicroFormat MannX&quot; but you can give it a better name.) If you use MannX as a local application, the two directories can go anywhere on your hard drive. If you are using an OWA, the two directories have to go to a specific place on your hard drive, as explained in the <a href="#owa" title="Off-Line Web App Installation">OWA section</a> below. </p>


<h3 id="localapp">Local Desktop Application</h3>
<p align="left">To use MannX as a local application,  you   need general requrement above. If you do not have an Internet connection, we can provide all the installers on a CDROM, together with the MannX materials themselves. However, you do need to connect to the Internet once, to adjust the setting your Flash plugin so that it can play local files on your computer. This can only be done at the <a href="http://macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings-manager04.html" target="_blank">Adobe website for Flash Player settings manager</a>, where you specify which directory or directories the plugin can access. You will specifiy the directory that contains the two MannX directories. </p>


<h3 id="owa">Off-Line Web application </h3>
<p align="left">For PlayerPlus and Authoring, MannX uses local storage currently support the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat web server</a>, which requires the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="_blank">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</a> installed on your computer. If you have JRE version 1.5 or later and Tomcat version 5 or later, you need no further installation.</p>
<p align="left">Both Tomcat and JRE are free. The installers can be downloaded from the Internet, and are also included on the CDROM. After the installers have been downloaded, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install Java by running the installer. This will also install a Java plugin for your Firefox browser. </li>
  <li>Install Tomcat by running the installer. Accept all defaults.</li>
  <li>Copy from the CDROM or download from the Web all the movies. </li>
  <li>Place the movies into the <code>movies</code> directory in the Tomcat <code>webapps</code> directory (On Windows, it will be similar to <br />
    <code>C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-tomcat-6.0.10\webapps\</code><br />
    except
    the version number may be different from 6.0.10).</li>
  <li>Copy from the CDROM or download from the web all the texts and software. Unzip into the same webapps directory. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">You can now   open the MannX-ELM home page by using this link:</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://localhost:8080/mannxelm/index.html" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/mannxelm</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Note</strong>: It may happen that an upgrade to the Firefox browser will require an upgrade to its Java plugin. If that happens (and it has happened once in the last two years), you will need to uninstall your JRE and install a fresh one. </p>
<p align="left">The problem of editing and saving local files from within the browser is under active development. Especially notable is the <a href="http://gears.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Gears</a> project. It is possible, indeed likely, that MannX will be using Google Gears as soon as it is released for use in applications. </p>


<h2 id="starting">Starting the MannX Player</h2>
<p>The best way to open a lesson
  in the MannX Player is from the MannX-ELM home page or from the homepage for the course. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img class="scrshot" src="scrshots/mannxHome70.png" alt="MannX Homepage" width="664" height="350" /></p>
<p>The home page for a course in addition contains links to individual units (lessons) in the panel on the left. Moving your mouse over those links places a brief description of the unit in the main panel. The dropdown menu for Courses has links both to the units of this course and to other courses.</p>
<!--p style="text-align:center; margin:0; padding:0"><img class="scrshot" src="scrshots/algoHome80.png" alt="MannX Homepage" height="400" /></p-->
<p>If you are using MannX as a desktop application, you can open the home page for the entire site or for an individual course by clicking on the corresponding index.html page. </p>
<p>To open the site home page as a Web application (online or offline) use the appropriate link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/mannxelm/" target="_blank">http://csproj2.colgate.edu:8080/mannxelm/</a><br/>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/mannxelm/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/mannxelm/
</a></p>
<h2 id="screen">The
MannX Screen</h2>
<p> The MannX screen  consists of  three main panels. In one common arrangement, the movie is in the top-left quater of the screen, the dictionary is on the bottom left, underneath the movie, and the texts occupy the right half of the screen. (The dictionary controls at the top can also be used for search through the texts of the unit, see the section of <a href="#dict">dictionary lookup and search</a>.) </p>
<p>Normally, you will want to expand the browser window to its maximal size. In the unlikely event that video control buttons overlap with dictionary controls, try closing one or two toolbars. </p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h3 id="algo3a">Example: Three panels, CS lecture, Text on right
  <!--img src="csLectureTextRight.png" alt="CS Lecture, Text Right" width="800" height="600" longdesc="csLectureTextRight.png"/-->
</h3>
<p>This example shows an excerpt from a lecture in the MIT introductory course on Algorithm Analysis. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img class="scrshot" src="scrshots/algo0101aCropped.png" alt="Algo1 Lecture 1 a" /></p>
<p>Each segment consists of the transcript of the video segment and two commentaries. The first commenary shows a paraphrase of the transcript, in simpler and grammatically correct language. (The transcript contains many,  typical features of spoken language, such as false starts, interruptions, digressions, filler words, and so on.) The second commentary provides explanations of grammar, vocabulary and usage. The currently selected segment has a gray-blue background, others have yellow background. </p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />

<p>You can also arrange  the movie and the dictionary share the top half of the screen and the texts occupy the bottom half. This arrangement is useful if your text consists of long lines that you do not want to be wrapped around. It is appropriate for interlinear glosses used in documentary linguistics.</p>
<h3 id="hkMrChung">Example: Three panels, Economics text, Simple English paraphrase, Exercise Link</h3>
<p>This three-panel  example shows an excerpt from a popular TV series on Economics, <em>Free to Choose</em>,
by Dr.Milton Friedman.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img class="scrshot" src="scrshots/ftcPencila.png" alt="Econ Pencil A" /></p>

<p>  As in the previous example, the commentary on each segment consists of two parts.
  The first part shows the text of the segment broken into simple sentences.
  (Dr.Friedman speaks in grammatical but quite complex English.)
  The second part contains explanations of grammar, vocabulary and usage. </p>
<p>Through simple <a href="#config" target="_self">customizations</a>, you can control:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how the panels are arranged; </li>
  <li>how much text shows in the text panel. The screenshot above shows a transcript and two commentaries. You can hide either or both of the commentaries.</li>
  <li>whether text lines are wrapped or not. </li>
  </ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />

<p>Web Application Screen: Waiting for Video Download</p>
<p>If you use MannX as a Web application, it may happen that you will try to play a segment before that segment has been downloaded from the server. The next screenshot shows what happens in this situation:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img class="scrshot" src="scrshots/algo0108loadSplash.png" alt="Waiting for video" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the user selected and tried to play the segment that starts within second 443, or at 7 minutes and 23 seconds. The movie has not yet loaded to that point. The message continuously updates the counter that shows how much of the movie has been loaded. You can wait till the counter reaches the time of your selected segment while using the dictionary and reading the text and the comments. Alternatively, you can select an earlier segment that has already beendownloaded; or you can click on the darker part of the video bar that corresponds to the downloaded part of the video and study that segment. </p>
<h2 id="segment">The
Central Concept: text/video segment</h2>
<p>The central concept of MannX
is&nbsp;<strong>the
text/video segment</strong>. The
video clip of a MannX lesson is divided into segments, usually a couple
of
seconds long and corresponding to a linguistic unit, such as a sentence
or an exchange in a dialog. The script is divided into matching
segments, and the two sequences of segments - video and textual - are
linked: if you select a text segment MannX can easily find the matching
video segment, and the other way around. As a result, the student can
play the same segment many times while reading its text and comments
linked to that text.</p>
<p>The usual way to go through a
lesson is to work through the segments in order until the text, the
sound, the vocabulary and the grammar of each segment are completely
understood. In the end, you have the satisfaction of playing the entire
clip (usually a few minutes long) and enjoying it as a movie.</p>

<h2 id="using">Using the MannX Player</h2>
<p>The central concept in using
the MannX Player is <strong>the
current selection</strong>. This is
usually a <a href="#segment">segment</a>,
but it can be several contiguous segments. </p>
<h3 id="setSelection">Setting the Current Selection</h3>
<p>There are three ways to set
the current selection. (See also the table of buttons below.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click anywhere in the text.
The segment that contains the location of the click will be selected.</li>
  <li>Click Next or Previous
button. The next or previous segment will be selected. In the beginning,
clicking Next selects the first segment. (<strong>Note</strong>: clicking on Next or Previous button while holding the Control key down with take you to the Next or Previous lesson, respectively.) </li>
  <li>Click anywhere in the movie's control bar. The video segment containing the click
will be selected; the script and the commentary window will be scrolled
to show the current selection.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<p>Most user interactions with the
program use the row of buttons in the movie
panel. They control the movie, dictionary, and grammar. The movie's
control bar is also available, for additional video navigation and
playback. Our buttons are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="dict">Using the Dictionary</h2>
<p>As you can see from the screenshots in the <a href="#screen">MannX Screen</a> section, the dictionary panel has three checkboxes in it, labeled Dictionary, Script and Commentary. This indicates that you can use the same text input either to <strong>look up</strong> a word in the dictionary or to <strong>search for it</strong> in the text or commentaries. There are four possibilities: dictionary checked (for lookup); text checked, commentary checked, or both checked (for search). </p>
<p>To<strong> look up</strong> a word either in the text or commentaries, hold Control key down and double-click on that word. Alternatively, you can type a word or a phrase in the text box above the dictionary and click the SEARCH button. </p>
<p>To search for a word or phrase, check text or commentary or both, type the word or phrase into the text box and click SEARCH. Clicking  SEARCH again will cycle through the occurrences of the word/phrase in the text. You can search for specific text strings (words or phrases) or for regulare expressions. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, simply ignore this remark or look them up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" title="WP article on Regular Expressions" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and use  references there to learn more.</p>
<h3>The
structure of a dictionary entry</h3>
<p>
A dictionary entry is a row in the dictionary table that consists of
three cells. The first cell gives has the English word of phrase, the
second cell gives its part of speech, and the third cell provides a definition in English or a gloss in a language other than English.

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>If a course has exercises in it (e.g., Free to Choose), then the row of buttons in the movie panel has an EX button. Clicking on it, opens the exercise panel. Initially it contains a summary of the grammatical and lexical material for the unit, with links to exercises. </p>

<p>Clicking on an exercise link displays an exercise. Each exercise consists of an explanation (preamble) followed by questions. The explanation usually contains a pattern to follow. You see one question at a time. Underneath each question is a text area to type in your answer. The buttons are self-expanatory. The exercises are strictly for self-study: there is no mechanism in this version to submit an exercise for review by an instructor.</p>
