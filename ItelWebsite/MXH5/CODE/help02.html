<h3><a name="whatIs" id="whatIs"></a>What is MannX? What is a MannX application?</h3>
<p> MannX (<em><strong>Multimedia Annotator - XML</strong></em>) is a browser-based 
  program that operates in either the authoring mode or in the playback mode. 
In the authoring mode, MannX allows the user to synchronize text with time-based media, such as movies or animations. In the playback mode, the user can play and replay video segments while viewing associated annotations, such as transcripts, 
  commentaries, and glossaries. </p>
<p>A MannX application is a collection of materials that together form a coherent course of study. For instance, MIRC (<em><strong>Multimedia Intermediate Russian 
    Course</strong></em>) is a MannX application that uses a version of MannX that 
    is customized for the Russian language and the Cyrillic alphabet. It presents 
    21 language lessons (we sometimes call them episodes) based on a <a href="AboutTheBook.htm">famous 
    Russian novel, <em>The 12 Chairs</em></a>. MannX  can just as well be used for teaching any other 
    language, or architecture, or zoology.</p>
<p>The main component of a MannX application is the MannX 
  Player which makes it possible for beginning and intermediary language students 
  to work with unabridged, idiomatic video and text. MannX can be used in a number 
  of ways, but a typical application would consist of episodes or lessons, each 
  packaged as a separate folder. Each folder contains texts which relate to a 
  video clip: a transcript, a commentary, and possibly a specialized glossary. 
  Video clips for a lesson set are large files, which may be left on a CD or DVD 
  or shared on a network drive, so the folder will not usually contain the video 
  clip itself. A large 
  dictionary and a set of grammar materials can be shared among all lessons. This 
  guide explains how to use the MannX player in a typical language lesson that consists of a video clip, its transcfipt, a commentary and a dictionary.<br>
<a href="#LT">top</a> </p>
<h3><a name="screen"></a>The MannX Screen</h3>
<p> The MannX screen is divided into four parts: movie, script, commentary, and
glossary.  The movie is in the upper left-hand corner. In three-frame mode, 
the script is on the right, and either the
commentary or the dictionary shows below the movie.
In four-frame mode, the script is below the movie, the dictionary is to the right
of the movie, and the commentary is below the dictionary.
</p>
<p>The central concept of MannX is <a name="segment"></a><strong>the text/video 
  segment</strong>. The video clip of a MannX lesson is divided into segments, 
  usually a few seconds long and corresponding to a linguistic unit, such as a 
  sentence or an exchange in a dialog. The script is divided into matching segments, 
  and the two sequences of segments - video and textual - are linked: if you select 
  a text segment MannX can easily find the matching video segment, and the other 
  way around. As a result, the student can play the same segment many times while 
  reading its text and comments linked to that text. (The linking of video to 
  text is done by MannX, the linking of script to commentaries is done in the 
  standard HTML way, using HTML links and anchors.) </p>
<p>The usual way to go through a lesson is to work through the segments in order 
  until the text, the sound, the vocabulary and the grammar of each segment are 
  completely understood. In the end, you have the satisfaction of playing the 
  entire clip (usually a few minutes long) and enjoying it as a movie.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="starting"></a>Starting </strong> <strong>The MannX Player</strong></h3>
<p>To open a lesson in the MannX Player, simply open the playerFrames.htm web page in the browser. It can be opened as a local file (by clicking on it), or it can be requested from a server by typing or clicking on a URL. The server can be on the same computer (the localhost) or anywhere on the internet, as long as your connection is fast enough to download a movie. For instance, on the computer on which this user guide is being written, there is a demo that can be run by connecting to the first URL below. The same demo can be run from our website, at the second URL: </p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/mx/wilson/playerFrames.htm" title="The Wilson Demo Local" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/mx/wilson/playerFrames.htm</a><br>
  <a href="http://n-topus.com/mx/wilson/playerFrames.htm" title="The Wilson Demo N-Topus" target="_blank">http://n-topus.com/mx/wilson/playerFrames.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Note: Close all other browser windows and maximize the splash screen 
  before starting the MannX Player.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><a name="using"></a>Using </strong> <strong>The MannX Player</strong></h3>
<p>The central concept in using the MannX Player is <strong>the current selection</strong>. 
  This is usually a <a href="#segment">segment</a>, but it can be several contiguous 
  segments. </p>
<h4><a name="setSelection"></a>Setting the Current Selection</h4>
<p>There are several ways to set the current selection. (See also the table of 
  buttons below.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click anywhere in the text. The segment that contains the location of the 
    click is selected.</li>
  <li>Click Next or Previous button. The next or previous segment is selected. 
    In the beginning, clicking Next selects the first segment.</li>
  <li>Similary, click anywhere in the comment window, and click the "C" button to
    synchronize movie and script to selected comment.
    The corresponding text-video segments will 
    be selected and the movie and script windows scrolled to show the current 
    selection.</li>
  <li>Click anywhere in the movie's control bar (or play the movie to any
    particular point). Click the "M" button
    he video segment containing the current movie time will 
    be selected; the script and the commentary window will be scrolled to show 
    the current selection.</li>
  <li>To select more than one segment, drag your mouse over a stretch of text 
    in the script window. The segments containing the area you have dragged over 
    will be selected. If you click Play, the selected segments will be played 
    continuously.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="buttons"></a>Buttons and the Sync List</h4>
<p>Most user interactions with the program use the row of buttons (and one drop-down 
  list) in the movie frame. They control the movie, dictionary, and (when installed)
  grammar. The 
  movie control bar is also available, for additional video navigation and 
  playback.Our buttons are as follows:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" bordercolor="FFFFEF" bgcolor="FFFFCC">

  </tr>

<h3><strong><a name="dict"></a>Using the Dictionary</strong></h3>
<p>To look up a word, select the word in the text box immediately underneath 
  the movie and press <strong>D. </strong> If the dictionary is already present,
  you'll need to press <strong>D</strong> twice, because the first press will
  make it disappear. The dictionary will scroll so the entry 
  you need will be, most likely, at or near the top row of the dictionary table. 
  The reason for the uncertainty is that our dictionary does not try to reconstruct the dictionary  form of the word  by doing its  morphological 
  analysis. Most of the time it works; if it does not but you know the dictionary form, you can type it into the small search box at the top of the dictionary and look up the definition. For a large-scale application, a morphological analyzer can be built into the the dictionary. The computing platform of MannX allows easy incorporation of additional modules. </p>
<h4>Placing text in the scroll box</h4>
<p>When you set the current selection, the text of the selection is placed in 
  the scroll text box underneath the movie. In addition, if you select some text in the comment or indeed 
  in the dictionary itself, the selection will be placed in the scroll box, replacing 
  what's there. (You select text in the comment and dictionary frames in the usual 
  way, by dragging or double-clicking your mouse.) You can also type text into the scroll box, and in a larger application it can be used for student input and testing. </p>
<h4><a name="contacts"></a>Problems? Let us know</h4>
<p>MIRC has a substantial dictionary (over 6,000 entries) and an extensive grammar. 
  In spite of our strenuous effort, there may well be errors and typos in them. 
  Fortunately, they are easy to fix in an electronic publication. Please email 
  your comments and corrections to <a href="mailto:snakhimovsky@mail.colgate.edu">Alexander</a> 
  or <a href="mailto:anakhimovsky@mail.colgate.edu">Alice</a> Nakhimovsky.</p>
