    	<h2>About Itelmen</h2>
    	<p>Originally Itelmen was spoken throughout Kamchatka, and possibly also in the northern Kuril Islands. Vladimir Atalsov, who annexed Kamchatka and established military bases in the religion, estimated in 1697 that there were about 20,000 ethnic Itelmens. The explorer Stepan Krasheninnikov, who gave the first detailed description of the Itelmen language and culture, identified the three main dialects, but explained that all Itelmens could understand each other</p>

    	<h2>News & Events</h2> 
		<p>In 1930 a Latin-based alphabet was designed for all the native languages of northern Siberia, and in 1932 a 27-letter Itelmen alphavet was created. A few textbooks were written in this alphabet during the 1930s, but it was quickly abandoned. More recently a Cyrillic-based alphabet, designed in 1986 and consisting of 32 letters, has been used.</p>
